# Privacy Policy for Arabic Grammar - قواعد اللغة العربية

**Effective Date:** [Date - e.g., April 3rd, 2025]

This Privacy Policy describes how [Your Name/Company Name] ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with the "Arabic Grammar - قواعد اللغة العربية" mobile application (the "App").

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what information, if any, the App collects and how it is used.

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

The App is designed primarily as an offline educational tool. We **do not** collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from you through the App. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Your name
*   Your email address
*   Your phone number
*   Your physical address
*   Your precise location data
*   Your contacts
*   Photos or other media from your device (other than assets packaged with the app)
*   Device identifiers like Advertising ID (unless required implicitly by third-party services like Google Play Billing, see below)

## 2. Information Collected Locally on Your Device

The App utilizes features that store data *only* on your device:

*   **Lesson Favorites:** When you mark a lesson as a "favorite" using the heart icon, this preference is saved locally on your device using Android's `SharedPreferences`. This information is used solely within the App to:
    *   Display your favorited lessons in the "Review" section.
    *   Show the correct heart icon (filled or outlined) next to lessons in the lesson list.
    *   This favorite information is **not** transmitted to us or any third party. It remains entirely on your device. You can remove a lesson from your favorites within the App, which deletes that specific preference. Clearing the App's data or cache through your device's settings will also remove all stored favorites.

## 3. Information Collected for In-App Purchases (Google Play Billing)

The App offers optional in-app purchases to unlock full access to all lessons and MCQs beyond the initial free tier. These purchases are processed through **Google Play Billing**.

*   **What Google Collects:** When you make a purchase, Google Play Billing handles the transaction directly. Google may collect information necessary to process the payment, such as payment details and purchase history, according to their own privacy policy. We **do not** receive or store your sensitive payment information (like full credit card numbers).
*   **Purchase Status:** The App interacts with Google Play Billing solely to verify whether you have purchased the "full_access" item. This verification allows the App to grant you access to the premium content. We store a simple flag indicating whether access is granted (`hasFullAccess`), but this is tied to the purchase status managed by Google, not directly to your personal identity within our systems.
*   **Google's Privacy Policy:** We strongly recommend you review Google's Privacy Policy to understand how they handle your data during the purchase process: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

## 4. How We Use Information

As we collect minimal information, its use is limited:

*   **Lesson Favorites Data (Local):** Used solely to provide the favorites feature within the App as described above.
*   **Purchase Status Data (via Google Play):** Used solely to unlock premium content within the App after a successful purchase verification.

## 5. Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share any information collected by the App (specifically the locally stored favorites) with third parties, except:

*   **Google Play Billing:** Purchase-related information is handled by Google as described in Section 3.
*   **Legal Requirements:** If required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

## 6. Data Storage and Security

*   **Local Storage:** Lesson favorite preferences are stored locally on your device using standard Android mechanisms (`SharedPreferences`). The security of this data depends on the security of your device.
*   **Purchase Data:** Purchase transaction security is handled by Google Play Billing.
*   We take reasonable measures to protect the information within our control, but no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 7. Children's Privacy

The App is intended for a general audience and is not specifically directed at children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age threshold in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we will take steps to remove such information.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on the App's listing page, and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
